was seated at a considerable distance from the orator, near the Treasury.

magna in lzoc...armata est, ‘great indeed is the energy, and incredible
the courage implied in the defendant’s character, such strength too and
resources as belong to no one individual,—-if it is the fact that the most
distinguished captain of his day has been selected, and the whole common-
wealth armed, against this single man.’

sought an interview with Pompeius when shut up in his gardens, but had.

civil privileges were in danger.‘ Se is emphatic by position, as being anti-

in Roman law for the status of a citizen; and he who lost or was degraded
from that status was said to be capite deminutus, or capitis minor. See
Dict. ofAntz'q. art. Caput, and comp. Hor. Oa'. 111. 5, 4² 3—-

te antestaretur, ‘ he would appeal to you (as his witness).‘ If a defend·
ant would not obey the summons of the plaintiff, the latter was said
’ antestari when he called on any present to be witness that the defendant
had been duly summoned; it was the custom to touch the ear of the wit-
ness on these occasions: comp. Hor. Sat. 1. 9, 75—78:

Cicero means to say that if Milo had gone into exile, Pompeius himself
would one day have borne witness to Milo's patriotism‚ by admitting his
mistake in depriving himself of so warm a friend, and so staunch an
