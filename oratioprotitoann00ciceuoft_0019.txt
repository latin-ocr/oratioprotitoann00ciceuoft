reports that had been spread about himself. It was also said that

Milo sent a message to Pompeius, who was a strong supportet of
Hypsaeus his former quaestor, expressing his willingness (if Pom-
peius wished it) to retire from the contest for the consulate. The
reply was, that Pompeius 'could not give advice to anybody 011 the
subject either of commencing or desisting from a canvass, nor had
he any wish to interfere with the powers, deliberations, or deci-
sions of the Roman people. He was even said to have sent a
communication afterwards through C. Lucilius, one of Milo’s
friends on account of Cicero’s intimacy with Lucilius, requesting
Milo not to bring him into difficulty by consulting him upon this

peius was to be dictator, and that the disorders in the state
could not be properly repressed by any other means. The
nobles thought it best, however, to appoint him sole consul3
and accordingly, after some debate upon the subject in the
Senate‚ he was created consul on the twenty-fifth of February
(intercalary month 4³), by the Interrex Servius Sulpicius, according

of bloodshed on the Appian Road, the burning of the Senate-house,
and the attack on the house of the Interrex M. Lepidus; the other
against corrupt practices at elections (de ambitu). The penalty for
these offences was made more severe, and the forms of proceedings
abridged; for both the laws enacted that three days should be
allowed for the previous examination of the witnesses and that then
both the accuser and the accused should close their pleadings on
the same day, two hours being all'owed to the accuser, and three

says that the Senate acted on the
advice of Cato in appointing Pom-
peius sole consul (ΙΙ. 23). This dif-
ference may however be reconciled
by the statement of Plutarch, that
the motion of Bibulus was strongly
seconded by Cato. (Pompeius, c. 54.)
