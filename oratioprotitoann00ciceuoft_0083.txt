1scu. κν. ξ 39.] Notes on Cicero Pro Mdonc. 57

longo intervallo, five years afterwards (B. c. 5 3), when Cicero was one
os Milo’s supporters in his oenvass for the consulship.
, nuper quidem...confecit. Asconius conjectures that Cicero refers to
a contest that took place in the preceding year in the Via Sacra between
’ὼε supporters of Milo and those of Hypsaeus in canvassing for the consu-
late, the leaders of whom were Cicero on one side, and Clodius on the
-other:—ad regiam, i. e. the palace of Numa in the Via Sacra.
ἓ 38. cuius mk...teneret. Comp. de Off 11. 17: ‘ sed honori summo
nuper nostro Miloni fuit quod gladiatoribus emptis reipublicae causa, quae
¹ salute nostra continebatur, omnes P. Clodii conatus furoresque repressit.’
See alsopro Sext. c. 42, § 92 ; ad Att. 1v. 3.
quum domum...defenderet. Cicero refers to this attack on one of
-Milo’s houses in a letter to Atticus (lv. gl: ‘Milonis domum, eam quae
‘in Germalo, pridie Idus Novemb. expugnare et incendere ita conatus est
ν ‘ut palam hora v. cum scutis homines eductis gladiis, alios cum accensis
¹ facibus adduxerit!
· Ρ. Sestio collega suo vulnerato. For an account of this proceeding, see
, ’,θνα Sext. c. 37. P. Sextius, or Sestius, was tribune of the plebs with Milo
⁴ in Β. C. 57, and exerted himself to obtain the recall of Cicero in that year.
'Like Milo, he kept a body of armed gladiators‚ who had frequent rencontres
in the streets with the partisans of Clodius, in one of which Sextius was
severely wounded and left for dead. He was afterwards brought to trial
for violence (de vi) by Clodius, and defended by Cicero in a speech still
extant.
Q. Fabn‘ab..prcls0. Comp. pro Sext. c. 35 : ‘princeps rogationis, vir
' mihi amicissimus, Q. Fabricius, templum aliquanto ante lucem occupavit...
Ι Quid illi quorum consilio P. Sestius in iudicium vocatur? quo se pacto
gerunt? Quum forum, comitium, curiam multa de nocte armatis hornini-
bus ac servis plerisque occupavissent, impetum faciunt in Fabricium, manus
adferunt, occidunt nonnullos, vulnerant multos...caedem in foro maximam
faciunt.’ Fabricius was another tribune of the plebs who took the part of
Cicero in Β. c. 57, and proposed a motion sor his recall in the January of
that year, which was defeated by Clodius in the manner described above.

L. Caecilii...oAflugnata domo. L. Caecilius Rufus was praetor in 57.
Asconius mentions a disturbance that took place in a theatre during a time
of scm-city, whilst he was holding the Ludi Apollinares. There is an
allusion to his services in promoting Cicero’s recall in the speech Post. red.
m sen. c. 9.

quum totius Italiae concursus...vindicaret‚ ‘when the assembled multi-
tudes from every part of Italy, who had been roused by the news of my
’ restoration, would have willingly acknowledged the splendour of such a
deed, so that, even though Milo had been the real author, the whole state
would claim the glory of it as its own.’ The words totius Italiae concursus
refer to the crowds that assembled in the provinces and at Rome, to
welcome the return of Cicero.

5 39. At quoderat tempus ?...‘ Now, what were the circumstances of
the period? There was a most brave and distinguished consul, who was
an enemy to Clodius, &c.'
