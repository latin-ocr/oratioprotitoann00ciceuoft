pscffltezpmbmm, ‘he was trapped in that vengeance which faithful
{hves wreaked on him in defence of their master's lise)

’ἒ 5 57. Cur agitur eos manu misit? As Roman citizens could not be
§courged or put to the torture‚ it was sometimes customary for masters to

¹ emancipate their slaves, that they might be exempt from torture. The

master was said servum manu mittere when he turned hlm round and
let him go from his hold before the praetor, after laying his hand upon the
slave’s head, and saying to the praetor, ‘ Hunc hominem liberum esse volo.’
The ceremony of emancipation was then performed by a lictor laying the
'md called vindicta or festuca upon the head of the slave, saying, ⁴ Dico
eum liberum esse more Quiritium.' See Dt‘ct. of A ntiq. art. lllanumissio.
metuebat scilicet ne indicarent, (ironically), ‘he was fearful, I suppose,

⁵ lest they should give informatum!

CHAPTER XXII.

ς 57. Quod 1'oilur..fi1temur, ‘that therefore which forms a proper

subject of inquiry ὧι· a legal process, we may here discuss3 as to the fact

ν’ 4

which you want to find out by means of torture, we admit it.’ The word
causa, in this sense, is thus defined by Cicero in his Topica, c. 21, ἓ 79 >
‘ quaestionum duo sunt genera, alterum infinitum, alterum definitum 3 defini·
turn εἰ quod ὑπόθεσιν Graeci, nos causam...Causa certis personis, locis,
temporibus, actionibus, negotiis cernitur, aut in omnibus aut in plerisque
eorum.

nesa's...rq>rehendere, ‘ you do· not know how to find fault with the act of
:m adversary ε’ i. e. you have not wit enough to discover his real faults.

ἓ 58. propter quos vivit, ‘to whom he owes his life ;' comp. pro Sese.
Roscio, c. 22: ‘ portentum atque monstrum est certissimum, esse aliquem
humana specie et figura, qui tantum immanitate bestias vicerit ut propter
quos hanc suavissimam lucem adspexerit eos indignissime luce privarit.'

defensores necis, ‘ who averted his murder :’ comp. pro Muraena, c. 2:
‘is potissimum consul qui consulem declaravit auctor beneficii populi
defensorque periculi esse debebit.' Dajfendcre, in its primary sense, is
‘to ward off ’ or ‘ parry‚’ the old verb findere meaning ‘ to hit‚' or ‘strike.’

quod minus moleste ferat, ‘which he takes more easily :' i. e. there was
none of Milo's missortunes which he was less disposed to grieve over,

ἵ because his loss of the services of so many slaves by their emancipation was
ss eounterbalanced by the pleasure of having secured an immediate reward
': for them, in mse of his own death.

si quid ipsi accidat, ‘if anything sh'ould happen to himself ;' the

,’ oonoepouding phrase in Greek was ἥν τι πάθῃ.

5 59. sed φωσώνια-...ἐπ atrio Libertatis, ‘but Milo is hard pressed by
the examinations which have been just held in the court of the Temple

⁸ of Liberty.’ The Atrium Libertatis was an area surrounded by colonnades

in front of the Temple of Liberty; it was situated on the Aventine, the

⁷ temple having been built by Tiberius Gracchus after his victory over the

‘ans at Beneventum (Liv. xxlv. 16). It was afterwards repaired
and enlarged by Asinius Pollio, who also added a valuable library (Suet.

>effug. c. 293 Plin. H. N. vn. 30). There was another less celebrated

Atrium Libertatis, near the Forum, mentioned by Cicero in a letter to
Atticus (rv- 16). See Dict. effAnu‘q. art. Atrium.
