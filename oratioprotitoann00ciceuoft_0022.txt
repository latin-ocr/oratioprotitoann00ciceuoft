suspicions in Pompeius against Milo, by loudly asserting that a<
conspiracy was on foot for his destruction. Pompeius now made
frequent complaints in public that his own life was in danger, and
consequently increased his body-guard. Plancus made a show of
bringing Cicero also to trial, and the threat was afterwards repeated
by Q. Pompeius Rufus. So great however was the firmness and
honesty of purpose shewn on this occasion by the orator, that nei-
ther his unpopularity‚ nor the suspicions of Pompeius, nor the sear
of future danger to himself, if he should be publicly impeached‚
nor the force which was now openly employed against his client,
could deter him from defending Mi103 although, if he had been
a little less earnest in his advocacy, he might not only have entirely
saved himself from personal risk and the hostility of an unfriendly
populace, but also have regained the favour of Pompeius.

9 As soon as the law of Pompeius was passed, Comitia were
held, in which L. Domitius Aenobarbus was appointed chief com-⁵
missioner (quaesitor) for the ensuing trials‚ in accordance with one 'j
of its provisions that such an officer should be elected by popular
suffrage from the number of those who had been consuls. The
panel of [360] judges also proposed by Pompeius, was such, that
certainly there never had been an occasion on which men more
distinguished or more scrupulously upright had been named as
judges. Immediately afterwards, Milo was put upon his trial under
the new act by the same two youths by whom his household was
before demanded ; he was also prosecuted by the Appii, C. Cetheius‚
and L. Cornificius, for corrupt practices; and lastly, for wholesale
bribery (de sodalitizlvffl) by P. Fulvius N eratus. But though he was
charged with wholesale bribery and corruption, it was hoped that if,
as seemed certain, he were first tried for breaches of the peace, and
(as was confidently anticipated) were condemned, he would not answer
to the other counts. A previous inquiry sor deciding who should be
the principal accuser (divinatioffl) in the trial for corruption was held
before a chief commissioner, named A. Torquatus; and both the
commissioners, Torquatus and Domitius, ordered Milo to appear at
the preliminary process on the fourth of April. On that day he pre—
