10 Causinius Sco'la gave evidence against Milo on the first
day of the trial; he deposed that he was with Ciodius when hu
was killed, and heightened the atrocity os the offence as much‘as'
possible. As soon as M. Marcellus had begun to cross-question·
the witness, the Clodian mob by whom he was surroundcd made
such an uproar, that he became alarmed for his sasety‚ and ναξ
admitted by Domitius on the bench (tribunalffl). Marcellus and

Milo himself now appealed to Domitius for protection. Cn. Pom-1
peius, who was then sitting at the Treasury‚ and had himself been
made uneasy by the disturbances which had taken place, made
a promise to Domitius that he would come down with a military.
escort on the following day. Accordingly, when he appeared, the
Clodians were so daunted, that they did not interrupt the examinas
tion of the witnesses during the two remaining daysffl. The wit*-
ncsses were cross—questioned by Marcellus, Cicero, and Milo him-'s
self. Several of the inhabitants of Bovillae gave their testimony
as to the facts which had occurred in their neighbourhood, deposing
to the murder of the tavern-keeper, the assault upon the tavem,
and the dragging of Clodius out into the highway. Some Vestala
of Albaf’*³ also said that a woman unknown to them had come for
the purpose of fulfilling a v0w‚ at the request of· Milo, in conse-
quence of the death os Clodius, The last witnesses were Sem-
proniaffl, the daughter of Tuditanus and mother-in-law os Clodius,
and his wife Fulvia, who produced a great sensation amongst the
bystanders by their sobbing. After the court broke up at about
four o'clock in the asternoon, Munatius Plancus harangued the
