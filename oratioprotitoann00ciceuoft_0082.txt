This and the next sentence are spoken ironically. There seems to be an
allusion here to the circumstance mentioned by Dion Cassius, who says
that Clodius actually had preferred an indictment against Milo sor offences
similar to those with which he was himself charged: Κλώδιος γραφὴν nard

diem mihi, credo, dixerat, ‘he had given notice osa day, 1 sup e, sor
my trial.’ Credo is here used ironically. The phrase diem dicere agg),- was
generally used in state-trials, when a magistrate named a day on which
