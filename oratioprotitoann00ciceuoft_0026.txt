present one having been written afterwards, and finished with suelq
care, that it may claim to be regarded as the firstfl.

⁸⁰ Comp. Dion Cass. XL. 54: ὀ
ῥήτωρ τόν τε Πομπήϊον καὶ τούς στρα-
πάντας ἐν τῷ δικαστηρίῳ παρὰ τὸ κα-
θεστηκός ἰδὼν ἐξεπλάγη καὶ κατέδει-
σεν, ὥστε τῶν μὲν παρεσκευασμένων
μηδὲν εἰπεῖν, βραχι) δέ τι καὶ τεθνηκὸς
χαλεπῶς φθεγξάμενον ἀγαπητῶς με·
ταστῆναι.

⁶¹ The original speech is now no
longer extant, with the exception,

erhaps, of a sentence or two cited
gy Quintilian. The author of the
Scholia Bobiensia says that it was
extant in his time: ‘Existit alius
praeterea liber actorum pro Milone,
111 quo omnia interrupta et impolita
et rudia, plena¹ denique maximi ter-
roas Cffilssgcaijion Cass. XL. 54: τοῦ·
τον ’γὰρ τὸν νῦν φερόμενον ὠς καὶ ὑπὲρ
τοῦ Μίλωνος τότε λεχθέντα χρόνῳ
ποθ’ ὕστερον καὶ κατὰ σχολήν ἀναθαρ-
σήσας ἔγραψε. He then relates the
story that when Cicero sent the im·
proved edition of his speech to Milo
in exile, the latter' 111 reply remarked
how fortunate it was that such a
speech had never actually been deli-
vered, since, in that case, he should
not have been enjoying such deli-
cious mullets at Massilia (Marseilles)
Dion adds, that the jest was not so
much intended to express his eon-
tentment with his present lot, as to
conve a sharp rebuke to Cice¹ro sor
his ilf timed display of oratorical
abilities, when Milo could no longer
profit by them.

Milo was condemned, the votes os
the judges being divided as follows.
—sor his condemnatum, η Senators,
1 3 Equites, and 1 3 Tribuni Aerariig

for his acquittal, 6 Senators, 4 Eqni
tes, and 3 Tribuni Aerarii. (Asconi-

us, notes on chap- 35 of the speech.»
Asconius adds that the judges apt
pear to have been aware that Clo·
dius was wounded in the first inm

was killed by Milo' sorder attenuatum*⁴
