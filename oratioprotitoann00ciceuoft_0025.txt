vpeople at a meeting, urging them to be present in large numbers
¹on the following day, and not suffergMilo to get off, but make their
÷20wn verdict on the case and their sympathy for Clodius apparent
to the judges when proceeding to the vote. Next day, which was
=the eleventh of April [ἒ the eighth; ἐξ 1, 98]‚ the shops were closed
throughout the city; Pompeius stationed guards in the Forum and
sits approaches, and took his seat himself,.as he had done the day
before, in front of the Treasury, with a body-guard of picked men.
'The choice of the judges by lot then took place very early in the
day, aster which as great a stillness prevailed throughout the Forum
as was possible in any Forum under such circumstances. Before
eight o'clock in the morning, the elder Appius, Marcus Antonius
and P. Valerius Nepos, commenced speaking for the prosecution‚
¹and consumed the two hours allowed them by the law. The reply
on the part of the defendant was made by Cicero alone. Some per-
.' sons were of opinion that the line of defence proper to be taken in the
:present instance was, that in killing Clodius Milo had proved himself
'a benefactor to the commonwealth ; and this was the line actually
adopted by M. Brutus in a defence of Milo which he wrote and
*published, as though it had been really delivered. Cicero, however,
:did not take this view, because though it might be for the public
,interest that a man should be condemned to death, it did not follow
rthat for the same reason he might be killed uncondemned. As
therefore the accusers had proceeded on the ground that Clodius
ἶ ,was waylaid by Milo, (which was salse, the quarrel having acci-
identany arisen‚) Cicero, taking advantage of their untenable posi-
Ltion, undertook to prove that Milo, on the contrary, had been
*waylaid by Clodius; and this is the gist of his whole speech.
'rhat point, however, being as incapable of proof as the other, it
then became evident, as 1 have said, that neither party had any
intention of fighting on that day, b'ut that the encounter was a
2;·casual one, the squabble between the slaves having led eventu-
‘ffally to the bloodshed which ensued. It was, neve1·,theless quite
,notorious that each of them had frequently threatened the life of
:the other; and while the largeness of his retinue was a suspicious
circumstance in Milo's case, the followers of Clodius, on the other
{Thand, were in better trim for fighting. As Cicero was beginning
{to speak, he was received with loud shouts from the Clodian party.
