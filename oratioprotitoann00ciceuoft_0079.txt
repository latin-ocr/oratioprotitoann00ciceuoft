si non iure...defindam, ‘if his act could not be justified, then Ι have no
defence to offer)

ratio, ‘right reason3’ mos, ‘custom.' ·

ἕ 31. iugulat—13 as we should say, ‘ to have his neck impenlled.’

Sin hoc...iniuria‚ ‘but if this is not the opinion held by· any one of
you, then the point now to be decided is, not whether he was killed, which
we admit, but whether he was killed justifiably, or not.’

notavit. See notes on § 14.

si hic...solvamur, ‘if the defendant plotted against the life of the de·
coesed, let him not go unpunished3 if deceased plotted against the life of
the defendant, then let us be acquitted of crime.’ For the phrase ut ne sit
impune, comp. Liv. 1. 58 3 ‘ haud impune adultero fore :‘ and Plautus,
Mcrc. 1V. 6, 4, ‘id si rescivit uxor, impune est viro.’

CHAPTER XII.

ἓ 3²· in illa lam audaci, tam nefaria belua, ‘in the case of a monster
of such daring impiety.’

Itaque illud Casszzznum...valeat, ‘and therefore let the famous test of
Cassius, “ for whose advantage was it?‘’ hold good in the case of the cha·
meters before us) L. Cassius Longinus was samed sor his severity as a
judge, and according to Valerius Maximus his tribunal was called scopulus
reorum (111. 7). The saying here mentioned is often referred to by Cicero;
as in his speech pro Rosc. Amer. c. 84 3 ‘ Lucius Cassius ille, quem populus
Romanus verissimum et sapientissimum iudicem putabat, identidem in
musis quaerere solebat CVI BONO FVISSET. Hunc quaesitorem ac iudicem
fugiebant atque horrebant ii quibus periculum creabatur, ideo quod, ta-
metsi veritatis erat amicus, tamen natura nontam propensus ad misericor-
diam quam implicatus ad severitatem videbatur) For the use of the word
persona, meaning ‘character,’ comp. pro Cluent. c. 29: ‘huius Staieni per-
sona ab nulla turpi suspicione abhorrebat.'

emolumento, ‘sels-interest! Emolumentum (derived from e and molae)
means ‘ grist,’ and hence ‘ profit) Fraus is here used for ‘ a treacherous' or
‘dishonourable act‚' as in the speech pro Rosczb Am. c. 21 : ‘haec te opinio
falsa in istam fraudem impulit.'

posse se eludere, ‘ he might have full swing,‘ or ‘ full play! This reading
is more sorcible and better supported than the common reading rem publi-
cam eludere, ‘baffle the state.' Comp. de Legg. 11. c. 21 ι ‘ sed quod iidem
iuris civilis estis peritissimi, scientia illa* (others read illam), eluditis-⁹
The metaphor is taken from the art of sencing.

corroboratam iam vetustate, ⁴ now grown inveterate by time.’

ἓ 33. vestrae...inusturus, ‘ are your ears abroad and unacquainted with
the common talk of the whole state, about the laws for the commonwealth
(if laws they should be termed, and not rather firebrands and seourges for
the city) with which that man was on the point of saddling us all, and
brandingus indelibly?' (as his slaves.) For the use of the word peregvi-
uantur, comp. Aristoph. Eq. 1 120, ὁ νοῦς δέ σου παρὼν ἀποδημεῖ.
