“5⁰⁰3- their fellow-citizensss Comp. Thuc. VI. 15: ὢν ἐν ἀξιώματι ὑπὸ τῶν
mxi hfnfiab...vicerint‚ ‘who have outdone their sellow-citizens in good
κτνέοὲῗγ. ἐἰ esset...praemiomm‚ ‘if the rewards must be taken into con-
'SIdz-angaelgrmlibm..adscendere, ‘by the steps of which even human beings
seemed to mount to heaven! Comp. paradoxa, 1. 2: ‘quibus tandem
&gradibus Romulus escendit in coelum? iisne quae isti bona appellant,
an rebus gestis atque virtutibus?

ἓ 98. nulla...vetustas‚ ‘no distant age shall ever cease to make
mention of me.’ Comp. Virg. Aen. x. 792:

Si qua fidem tanto est operi latura vetustas.

quum omnes...subiciantur; literally‚ ‘though brands of every kind are

’ being applied byv my enemies to the flame os ill-will against mez’ according

,⁷ to our idiom, ‘though every means is being used by my enemies to fan
“, the flame of ill-will against me.’ See notes on ἓ 75, and comp. Vell. Pater.

11. 48: ‘bello autem civili...non alius maiorem flagrantioremque
quam C. Curio tribunus plebis subiecit facem)
omni sermone celebramur, ‘we form the theme of every conversation.’
Omitto...diss‚ ⁸ Ι pass over the Etrurian festivals, both kept (already)
and appointed to be kept (hereaster :)’ i.e. to celebrate their deliverance

’ from the depredations of Clodius, mentioned in §§ 26, 74.

centesima...altera‚ ‘it is now a hundred and two days, I think, since

¹ Clodius perished.’ The el is generally omitted, as in Liv. 111. 33: ‘anno

trecentesimo altero :' and sometimes alter is put first, as in Cic. ad Fam.

- xn. 2: ‘altero vicesimo die’ (the two-and-twentieth day). The speech

was delivered, according to Asconius, on the 8th of April, and Clodius
was murdered on the zoth of January3 there was therefore an intercalary
month of twenty-three days between the twenty-third and twenty-fourth

of February. See Dict. of Antiq. art. Calendar, (Roman), pp. 179, 180,
and Introduction, ξ 6, n. 4²·

CHAPTER XXXVI.

ᾗ ἰ9. Te quidem quod...possum‚ ‘your-sels, indeed, 1 cannot praise
enoug for manifesting such a temper.‘ Many editions read quum instead
of quod, but it is doubtful whether quum was ever used with an indicative
in the sense of ‘since,' that is, with a purely causative signification.
navero...accessero, ‘and besides, if you are snatched from me, 1 have
not still left me that usual power of protest for my comfort notwithstanding
( our removal), that I could vent my spleen on those at whose hands I
should (in that case) have received so deep a wound.’ Observe, tamen
is to be taken in connexion with the words illa ad consolandum quenla,

' and not with reliqua est.

aliquando, ‘ at some time ε’ semper, ‘at all times)

Nullum unquam...ficen'tis‚ ‘there is indeed no paug that you will ever
cause to rankle in my breast so deeply,-and‚ though none could do so
more deeply‚ I will say it even of this very paug to which I was alluding,—
that 1 mn ever sorget the estimation in which you have always held me.’
