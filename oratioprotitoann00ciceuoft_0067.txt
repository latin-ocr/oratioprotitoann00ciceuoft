Scep. ch. 1: ‘sed ille, Ades, inquit, animo, et omitte terrorem! The

hrase adesse animo is used in two sensesz (1) ‘to pay attention,’ as
ln the speech pro Caecina, ch. 10: ‘is testis, ut facile intelligeretis eum non

amplisu'momm ordinum. By the Lex Aurelia, of which the praetor
L. Aurelius Cotta was the author (3.0, 70), it was enacted that the judges

and trying can be described or imagined than that in which we two are
placed?’ The epithet laboriosus is distinguished from miser in the second
book de Finibus, c. 28, ἕ 93; ‘nec tamen miser esse,—quia summum id

non abutemur, ‘we will not take advantage of.' The verb abuti, like
the Greek ἀποχρᾶσθαι, is used primarily in the sense of ‘to use up‚’ or
‘make full use of;’ hence ‘to take advantage of‚' and so, lasssy, ‘to misuse.'

mlvi oculis vestiet-itis, ‘if you do not in the end perceive, as plainly as
