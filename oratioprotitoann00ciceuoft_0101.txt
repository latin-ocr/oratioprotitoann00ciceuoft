Eu. xxx, §83.] Notes on Cicero Pro Mlone. 75

Α poet named Callistratus composed a very popular Ode in praise of
Harmodius, which is preserved in Athenaeus, xv. p. 695. ·

⁷ prope ad...consecrantur, ‘they are so much venerated as almost to obtain
the religious worship and commemoration proper to an immortal state of

being.

 

CHAPTER XXX.

5 81. nihil petit nisi ut ignoscatur, ‘looks for nothing but forgiveness-:¹-
ignoscatur must be taken here impersonally, the construction being msa
nt ignoscatur sibi.—praemia laudis, ‘ tributes of praise.’

quum praesertim—anzplzksimos, ‘especially when, in making that con-.
fession, if you chose to be not unthankful‚ he would attain to honours of the
‘highest kind.’ This clause refers to that which is implied rather than ex-
. pra-sed in the preceding words, viz. that the judges would feel more grate-
ful sor their own preservation than Milo's; the absurdity of the contrary
{lypotltifisis being indicated by the ironical expression miri vero, ‘unless

orsoo “

sed tamen si...a·vitate, ‘but still, Ι say, if the valour of a man of most
unflinching resolution should have turned out to be less acceptable to his
felleus-citizens than might have been expected, he would with high-minded
courage retire from an unthankful state.' By the imperfect cederet after
cecidisset in the foregoing clause, Cicero implies that Milo was still prepared
to take that course, if circumstances should require it. The expression
cm'disset is used metaphorically, the metaphor being taken from the ‘ salling'
or ‘ turning out’ of lots: comp. ad Q. Fratrem, 1. 3: ‘sed certe a te mihi
omnia semper honesta et iucunda ceciderunt3 a me tibi luctus meae
calamitatis, metus tuae!

ἕ 82. sine maximis dimicationibus meis, ‘without the greatest struggles
' on my part2’ comp. pro Plancio, c. 32, ἓ 77:-‘ nullas sibi ille neque con-

tentiones neque inimicitias, neque vita e dimicationes nec pro republica

ἒ nec pro me defugiendas putavit.’

= >· ἐ 83. Ahala...nosmetip5i. See notes on ἓ 8.

3. huius beneficii gratiam, ‘thankfulness for this blessingz' comp. de Fin.
„ 111. c. 22, ἓ 73 z—nec vero pietas adversus deos, nec quanta his gratia
» debeatur, sine explicatione naturae intellegi potest.—fortuna populi Ro-
3: mam. See above, ξ 6.

ἓξ qui nullam...1h·vinum, ‘who does not believe in any divine power or
ἰ influence? Comp. in Verr. IV. c. 49: ⁴ multa saepe prodigia vim eius
(Cereris) numenque declarant? Numen is derived from nuere, ‘ to nod3’
and hence it came to signisy divine direction or providenee. The original
s meaning of numen is found in Lucretius. 11. 633:

q Terrificas capitum quatienteis numine cristas.
i, For the secondary meaning, comp. Luer. 111. 144:

 

Caetera pars animae per totum dissita corpus,
Paret et ad numen mentis momenque movetur.
