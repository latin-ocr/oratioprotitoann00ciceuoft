companions were at the same time demanded by Caelius; and those
of Hypsaeus and Q. Pompeius by [his colleague Cumanus ?].

The counsel for Milo were Q. Hortensius, M. Cicero, M. Mar-
cellus, M. Calidius, M. Cato⁴¹, and Faustus Sulla. Hortensius
made a brief reply, in which he stated that the persons demanded
