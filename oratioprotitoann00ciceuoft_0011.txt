Q. ASCONIUS PEDIANUS¹.

ICERO delivered his defence of Milo on the eighth of

April [B.C.

52, U.C. 702], and in the third consulate of

Cnaeus Pompeius. During the progress of the trial the Forum
and all the temples in its neighbourhood were occupied by troops,
as we leam, not only from the following speech [§§ 1, 2] and the
records of the period, but also from the treatise ascribed to Cicero,
entitled De optimo genere Oratorum [ch. 4. ξ 10]

2 The candidates for the office of consul [in the year 52]
were T. Annius Mi102‚ P. Plautius Hypsaeus³, and Q. Metellus

1 Q. ASCONIUS PEDIANUS was third, srorn his father C. Papius Cel·
born about the commencement of'

the Christian era. He wrote com-
mentaries 011 the speeches of Cicero,
ents of which are still extant.
The genuineness of those on the
,Divinatio and the first two speeches
against Verres has been disputed by
Madvig and other modern critics
see Madvig's Disputatio Critica de
Q. Ascon. Ped. Commentariis.
² MILO was a name common
amongst gladiators in the south of
Italy, and therefore‚ probably, a
nickname given to him on account
of his notoriety as captain of some
of the paid assassins which infested
Rome and its environs at this time.
His τω] name was Titus Annius
Papianus; the second being derived
{romhisadoption by T. Annius Lus-
cus, his maternal grandfather, the

sus, who married Annia. He was
bom at Lanuvium, and in Β.0. 57
married Fausta, daughter of the dic-
tator Sulla. In the same year, as
tribune of the plebs, he came into
collision with the ex-tribune Clodius.
Failing in an attempt to prosecute
him for his acts of violence, he coI-
lected a band of arrned gladiators; ’
and thus began the series of contests
whi'ch ended so fatally in the death
of Clodius. In the year 53, when
canvassing for the consulate, he was
charged in the senate with insol-
vency by Clodius, and defended by
Cicero in a speech entitled de aere
alieno Alilanzlr, of which only a few
fragments remain. The events with
which the next year opened form the
subject of the present speech.

³ JP. Plautius Hypsaeus was tribune
