swords, and in other respeets equipped for fighting, according to
the practice of travellers at that period²⁷. Clodius had also three
friends with him, one of whom was a Roman knight named C.
Causinius Scola¹³, and the other two, whose names were P. Pom·
ponius and C. Clodius, were plebeians of obscure family. Milo
was riding in a travelling carriage with his wife Fausta, daughter
of L. Sulla the dictator, and his friend M. Fufius. They were fol-
lowed by a large body of slaves, some of whom were gladiators,
two notorious ones named Eudamus and Birria being of the num-
ber. The latter, who were in the rear and going rather slowly,
picked a quarrel with the slaves of Clodius, who, on looking round
at the affray with an air of defianc‘e‚ was run through the shoulder
by Birria with a rapiet ¹⁹. A fight ensued; and some more of Milo’s
party ran up to the spot. Clodius was carried, wounded, into a
tavern²⁰ in the district of Bovillae. Hearing this, and feeling that,
if he lived, the occurrence would be even then attended with some
danger to himself, but that it would be a great relies to him if
Clodius were killed, even though he himself had to suffer for it,
Milo ordered him to be hunted out of the tavemffi. M. Saufeius
led on the slaves of Milo; and by this means Clodius was dragged
forth from his hiding-place‚ and dispatched with several wounds”‚
His corpse was left in the road, as the slaves of Clodius were
either killed, or in concealment and severely wounded. A senator
named Sextus Tedius, who happened to be returning to the city
