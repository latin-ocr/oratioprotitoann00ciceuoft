from which he had come. The body of Clodius arrived at Rome

wife Fulvia2³ also inflamed the bad passions excited on the occasion

crowd of people of the same class poured in, and several persons
of distinction were crushed to death, amongst others a senator
named C. Vibienus24. I may mention tbat the house of Clodius

M. Scaurus a few months before. Two tribunes of the plebs,
Munatius Plancus, brother of the orator L. Plancusw, and Q.

thither ; at their instigation the rnob conveyed the body to the
Forum, and exposed it* on the Rostra, naked and bedabbled with
mud²⁷‚ just as it had lain upon the bed, that the wounds might be
seen. A meeting took place, at which Plancus and Pompeius, who
took the part of Scipio and Hypsaeus, heaped odium on Milo.
The people, headed by a clerk28 named Sextus Clodius, then carried
