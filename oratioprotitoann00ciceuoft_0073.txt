forth by the name of this same Appian Road2’ Comp. Quintilian, VI. 1,
362 ‘in parvis litibus has tragoedias movere tale est quasi personam

Is disconsolate3 the whole state is bowed down; the free-towns vwear a
garb of woe; the colonies are cast down; and finally, the very fields are
pining sor a citizen so kindly, so useful, so tractable.’ Municipium was
