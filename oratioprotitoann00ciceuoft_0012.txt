Scipio⁴. Their canvass was conducted with the help os parties
armed ruffians, together with the most shameless and unstmted,
bribery. The principa] supporterof Scipio and Hypsaeus against Milo} 1
was P.C1odius⁶. A bitter enmity had existed sor some time between}
Clodius and Milo, on account of Cicero's friendship sor the latter,
and the activity displayed by Milo in promoting the orator’s reoall3
from banishment [B.C. 57]. So great was the hostility between
them, that they had often come to blows within the city at the-s
head of their respective clubs, each of them being a match sor*
the other in audacity‚ though Milo had the advantage of fighting
sor the better cause. Clodius was himself aspiring to a praetorship
in 52, and therefore had an additional motive sor opposing Milo,
whose elevation to the consulate in the same year would groetly
thwart the execution of his own designs. The meetings of the
comitia ‚sor the election of consuls had been long protracted⁸, and
at last rendered quite impracticable by the scandalous conteets
os the candidates ς so that there were neither consuls nor praetors
in the month of January [B.C. 52]. · Ιιι the meantime Milo made
strenuous endeavours to obtain a final decision in his favour, and
seemed to be on the eve of success. He was supported by the
better class of citizens on account of his resistance to Clodius, and
by the populace, because he had won them over to his side by
bribes, dramatie exhibitions‚ and costly shows of gladiators, on
which, as Cicero intimates‚ he had squandered no less than three
