Introduction. xvii
next meeting P. Cornificius⁴⁹ affirmed that Milo had a weapon
attached to his thigh beneath his tunic, and called on him to bare
his thigh. Milo lifted up his tunic without hesitation; whereupon
Cicero exclaimed that this was only a sample of all the other
charges falsely brought against his friend. The tribune Munatius
Plancus afterwards brought forward a person named M. Aemilius
Philemon, well known as a freedman of M. Lepidus, before a pub-
lic meeting. His story was, that he and four other freemen besides
himself, as they were travelling, carne up to the spot where Clodius

was being killed, and that on their calling out for help in conse-

. quence, they were seized and taken off to Milo's villa, and kept

η there in confinement for two months. This report, whether true or

’ false, had done much injury to Milo. The same Plancus and-his

colleague Q. Pompeius had brought forward a Capital Triumvir⁵⁰
on the Rostra, and questioned him whether he had detected one of
Milo's slaves named Galata committing murder. He replied that
the. slave had been caught asleep in the tavern as a runaway, and
brought into his court. The tribunes, notwithstanding, warned the
Triumvir not to discharge the slave ; on the next day, however, the
tribunes Caelius and Cumanus took him by force from the house of
the Triumvir, and gave him back to Milo. Having met with these
charges, I have thought it right to mention them, though not alluded
to by Cicero. The tribunes Q. Pompeius, C. Sallustius, and Muna-
tius Plancus, were among the foremost in exciting ill-will against

ι Milo by their inflammatory speeches. Cicero also was attacked in

the same manner, as Milo’s zealous partizan3 and indeed so un-
popular with the masses was his advocacy of the latter, that they
regarded him with quite as much aversion as his client. Pompeius
and Sallustius were afterwards suspected of a reconciliation with
Cicero and Milo. Plancus however continued their most bitter
adversm, instigating the populace against the orator, and exciting
