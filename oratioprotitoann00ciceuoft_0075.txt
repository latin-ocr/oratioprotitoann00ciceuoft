himself wished that, though there was no dispute about the fact, the ques-
5tion of ngrht should notwithstanding be discussed3 if the judges were
ι picked men, and the president appointed was one who would fairly and
wisely investigate the subject.'...Disceptare has two meanings: (1) ‘ to dis—
cuss ’ or ‘ debate‚’ when several persons are engaged ; (2) ‘to examine into ’
, or ‘investigate,’ when one person is engaged, as in the speech pro rege
‘ Deiotaro, ch. 2: ‘ Hanc enim, C. Caesar, causam si in foro dicerem, eodem
audiente et disceptante te, quantam mihi alacritatem populi Romani

concursus afferret.’
uter utri insidias fecerit, ‘which of the two plotted against the life of

⁹ the other! Comp. Hor. Epist. 11. 1, 55:

ssmbigitur quoties uter utro sit prior, aufert
acuvius.

J ⁶ Also Virg. Aen. 1v. 371 z—‘quae quibus anteferam.'

rem gestam, ‘ the facts as they occurred.'

ἓ 24. videretque...posset‚ ‘and seei'ng that the comitia in the preceding
year had been so protracted that he could not hold the praetorship many
months.‘ The consuls of the year preceding that in which the trial of
⁴ Milo took place were Cn. Domitius Calvinus and M. Valerius Messala.
The consuls held the comitia for the election of their successors and the
praetors; and, according to Dion Cassius (XL. 45), Calvinus and Messala
had not been able to enter upon office before six months of the new year
had expired: ὥστε μόλις ἑβδόμῳ μηνὶ τόν τε Καλουΐνον καὶ τ’ὀν Μεσσαλᾶν
ὑπάτους ἀποδειχθῆναι. The election of the praetors seems to have been
equally delayed.

qui nan...spectaret‚ ‘as the mere promotion to a higher rank was not
lais object.’ Qui has here a causative signification, and is therefore followed
by a subjunctive. The Greek ὅστις is sometimes employed in the same
manner.

L. Paulum. Lucius Aemilius Paulus belonged to the family of the
Lepidi, being a brother of M. Lepidus the triumvir. He favoured the
aristocratical party, and exerted himself in favour of Cicero’s recall in
B.c. 57. In 53 he was praetor, and succeeded to the consulship in 50, to-
gether with M. Claudius Marcellus. He was afterwards proscribed by his
own brother Lepidus, but escaped to Asia. Cicero describes him as
‘ hominem ad conservandam rem publicam natum ; ¹ in Vatin. c. 10, ἕ 25.

reliqut't annum suum, ‘he went out of his proper year! candidates
for the praetorship were required to be forty years of age by the law of the
tribune L. Villius Annalis, B‚C. 179. See Liv. XL. 44. A person resign—
ing one of the offices of the state could not be a candidate for the next
higher office that fell to his lot, until a period of two years had expired.
Clodius had been curule aedile in Rc. 56, and was therefore eligible for
the praetorship in B.c. 53.

non reltgz'orze aliqua, ‘not in consequence of any religious scruple:' i.e.
not bemuse he had observed the auspices to be unfavourable to his elec-
tion. See Dict. qf Antiq. art. Auspicium—ut fit, ‘as is the practice3'
see ξ 28.

ἓ ²5. Occurrebat...M‘lone‚ ‘the thought was continually suggesting
itselfmthat his praetorship would be crippled and powerleSS, if Milo were
cons .

Debilis (de-habilis) is primarily applied to a person who has not the
suu use of his limbs, and is therefore disabled. Alancus is ‘ crippled’ οι
‘maimed,’ as in Iuv. Sat. 1. 3, 48:

atque ideo nulli comes exeo, tanquam
Mantus et exstinctae corpus non utile dextrae.
