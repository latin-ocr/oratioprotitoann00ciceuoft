which means the Senate-house itself was set on fire, together withJfi
the Porcian Basilica³⁰ next door to it. The same mob proceeded'·
to attack the house of the Interrex M. Lepidus³¹ (who had beuti
appointed a superior magistrate), and also that of Mssoaz, in his}
absence ; from the latter, however, they were repulsed with arrowa- ⁴
Thereupon they carried off the fasces from the couch of Libitina, ¹
and took them to the house of Scipio and Hypsaeus first, and then
to the gardens of Cn. Pompeius, shouting out his name as they went
along, sometimes as consul, sometimes as dictator.

4 The burning of the Senate-house excited public indigna-
tion still more strongly than the fate of Clodius. Reassured
by the odium thus cast upon his adversaries, Milo, who, though ἶ,
generally thought to have gone into voluntary exile, had returned ἶ
to Rome the very night on which the Senate-house was set on fire, ν
was now proceeding with his canvass as actively as ενοι-9, openly
distributing 1000 ases (more than ,gz of English money) apiece to
the voters of each tribeffl. A few days afterwards the tribune
Caelius³³ gave Milo an· opportunity of addressing the people, and
spoke himself in vindication of his conduct, both of them asserting
that Milo was waylaid by Clodius¹⁶.

refused to hold the comitia for the
election of consuls, on the ground
that it was not usual for the first In-
terrex to do so; which gave offence
to the Clodian mob. ‘ Domum eius
