but eut short by death, of our friend the tribune here who was ao badly
seorched, in which he used daily to make invidious reflections on my
supremacy.' The allusion is to the inflammatory speech-s os T. Munatius

ducaetzltzrgizsti. Perhaps there is a play here upon the word ambustus. vinidi

may mean both ‘scorched’ by the flames os the Senam-house, and ‘blattea'
in character. Comp. Liv. xxu. 35: ‘L. Aemilium Paulum, qui cum M,
Livio consul fuerat et damnatione collegae et sua prope ambustus evasa-t
...ad petitionem compellit.‘ See also de Har-usp. Resp. c. 3, θ 4.

Quae quidem...gratia. Potentia, ‘supremacy,’ differs from potestas, ‘civil
power3' auctoritas is ‘moral influence;’ gratia. ‘po ularity.' ’

cuius enim...erepta. The allusion is to the proceedings against Clodiu*
aster his profanation of the mysteries of Bona Dea in the house os Pompei&
Caesar's wife (3.6. 62). The Senate had referred the matter to the Ponti-
fices, who declared it an act of sacrilege; upon which the constils made
a motion sor the ap ointment os an extraordinary tribunal, in which the
judges should be se ected by the praetor. This being defeated ἰ
the influence os the Clodian facticii, Hortensius at length yielded to e
proposal of Q. Fufius Calenus that the judges should be chosen by lot,
as usual. Clodius was then arraigned by L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus, bnt
was acquitted by a majority of the judges. For Cicero's account of these
events, see his letters to Atticus, 1. ep. 13-16. See also Drumann’s Goech·
