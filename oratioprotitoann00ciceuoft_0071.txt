CHAPTER VI.

Itaque egv...notavi, ‘and so 1 mysels recorded my opinion, sinces't was

ho had acted in sels-defence had committed an offence against the com·

'lest it to a court of justice to decide the question of guilt (i.e. where the
ilt lay); the affair itself I stigmatized'-(by his vote in the Senate). Notare
ere means ‘to mark with disapprobation,’ in which sense it occurs· again

furiosum illum tribunum, ‘that raving tribune? viz. T. Munatius
laneus.

decernebat enim, ‘for it was on the eve of deciding.' This was on
the motion of Hortensius. The imperfect here expresses the incompletenm
¹of the action; extra ordinem, by means of a special commission, when
[the ordinary courts were not sitting.

Divisa sententia est, ‘a separate vote was taken-¹ When a motion
'consisted of more than one proposition, any member of the Senate
‘might call sor a division on each, separately, by crying out ‘Dividel
[Hence ‘dividere sententiam’ meant to take a separate vote upon each
ff of the proposed resolution. See ad Fam. 1. 2, ἓ 1. In the present

tance the motion before the Senate consisted of two parts3 the first
declared the killing of Clodius and the disturbances that followed to be
offences against the public peace (see§ 13); in the second it was proposed
that a special commission should be appointed to investigate the matter
,s according to the existing laws (veteribus legibus, tantum modo extra
¹ ordinem). The first part of the motion was carried, Cicero himself voting
¹ sor it; the second was quashed by the veto of Calenus.

postulante nescio quo, ‘on the demand of some one or other.' This
is probably said in contempt3 sor Asconius quotes a speech of Munatius
Plancus in which the latter names Q. Fufius Calenus as the person.

this veto was exercised by the tribunes Plancus and Sallustius (who, as
Cicero intimates, had been bribed by the party of Clodius) against that
part of the motion of Hortensius which proposed that Clodius should be
tried by a special commission according to the established laws.

ἕ 15. At enim, ‘but then we are told that.' At enim is osten used
to introduce an objection 3 as in Cic. de Nat. Deor. 11. 27: ‘At enim
minora dii negligunt...sic enim dicitis, quasi etc.'

re, ‘the fact ;' causa, ‘the issue to be tried.'

. facta esset...0ccisus esset. These verbs are in the subjunctive mood,
because Cicero is here bringing forward the objections of others, and
therefore, according to the grammatical phrase, speaks in the oratio obliqua.

Quid...nempe ut quaereretur, ‘What then was his motion? Of course
fot inquiry.’ For this use of nempe, comp. ch. 3, § 7.

paret, ‘it is patent! ‘Si paret’ was a common legal phrase: see in

the fact was admitted, a plea of justification might still be sustained! In
