“It ts difficult to commend too highly this excellent sm'es.—Guardian.

“ ne modesty ῳ( the general title qs this sen‘es has, we believe, led ¹
many to misunderstand its character and underrate its valae. The books
are well suited fhr study in the upper forms of our best schoah, but not
the less are they adapted to the wants of all Bible students who arc not
specialists. We doubt, indeed, whether any of the numerous popular
commmtaries recently issued in this country will be found more ser·
viceablesor general use.”-Academy.
