in elicissimir ltssgnis semiustilatum, ‘charred and blackened on a pile of
most unlucky saggots:' i. e. not burnt decently and honourably upon a
regular funeral pile, but only half-bumt by the conflagration of the benches,
&a in the Senate-house (Introd. ἓ 3). These are described as ‘unlucky'
or ‘ill-omened faggots,’ just as ‘infelix lzgrnum’ means the unlucky gallows-
tree. Compare the use of the plural infelicia ltjgna by Catullus in his Ode
in Annales Volusii (XXXVI. 8):

Vovit, si sibi restitutus essem,
Electissima pessimi poetae
Scripta tardipedi deo daturam
Infelicibus ustilanda lignis.

crudelitatem expronfflsisti tuam, ‘you gave vent to the whole emelty of
your character.’ Expromere is ‘to draw out‚' as from a vessel or store-house.
Comp. Plaut. Mil. 1v. 2, 64, ‘exprom e benignum ex te ingenium.’

§ 34. ⁴* ⁴ ⁴ suerit. The gap at the beginning of this section is filled
up by Halm and other editors with the words ‘audistis, iudices, quan-
tum Clodii interfuerit occidi M.'

quid erat...optaret‚ ‘what reason was there why Milo should—I will not
say, commit the deed (himself) but—wish for its commission (by others)?’
Tloe phrases admittere scelus, facinus, &c- are used, sometimes with, and
sometimes without, the addition of the words in se: see ch. 37, ξ ¹03 5 Off
111. 2 0

A‘t5 eo...magis, ‘yes but he was going to be made consul notwithstanding
his opposition 3 nay, all the more so on account of it.' The imperfect fiebat
refers to the progress of the election. In the next sentence suffragator means
’a supporter,' one who not only voted for a candidate, but actively pro-
moted his election.

solutam, ‘if let loose3’ rerum novarum, ‘of a revoluti0n3’ constringere,
‘to tie it down,’ i. e. by means of laws, the metaphor being taken from tying
up an animal, so as to prevent it from doing mischief: comp. pro Sext. c.
4¹² ‘ut illum...legum, si posset, laqueis constringeret.'

utitatis rebus, ‘by ordinary means! These words are antithetical to
those at the beginning of the next sentence—iam, ‘hencesorth.'

aeratatzbnem, ‘opportunity for practising.'

sufflagationem consulatus, ‘the support that was given him (in his
canvass) sor the consulship.'

temptari coeptus est, ‘has begun to be attacked τ’ comp. pro Rosc. Am.
e. 51 z ‘summa respublica in huius periculo tentatur.'

ἕ 35. At valuit odium, ‘ah, but (it will be said) there was the strong
motive of hatredz’ comp. Liv. xxxvln. 28, ‘metus ad omnes valuit, ne
deditionem recusarent.'—iratus‚ ‘in a passion.’

punitor doloris sui, ‘an avenger of the mortification which he felt? So
Cicero speaks of the ‘cupiditas puniendi doloris.' de Orat. 1. c. 51.

quid enim...odimus‚ ‘sor what enmity could Milo have felt towards
Clodius, by whom he had reaped glory‚ and aehieved renown, beside that
politica-l eumity which we feel towards all bad men?’ Civile odium is
enmity felt by one citizen towards another on politic-al or social grounds,
as distinguished from that which is personat. Comp. de Nat. Deor. 11. c. 30:
‘atqui necesse est, quum sint di...ani1nantes esse, nec solum animantes,
sed etiam rationis compotes, inter seque quasi civili conciliatione et societate
coniunctos.

Ille erat ut odisset, ‘there was a reason for his hating one who was &c.’
Comp. de Divin. 1. 56, ‘Non est igitur ut mirandum sit2’ the pronoun
eve is put first for the sake of antithesis.
