5 Meanwhile fresh Interreges were succeeding one another, all
of whom were unable to proceed to the election of consuls, on
account of the disturbances exeited by the candidates and the
bodies of armed men that were still kept on foot. The Senate
therefore passed a resolution that the Interrex for the time being
y and the tribunes of the plebs, together with Pompeius, who as pro-
consul was outside the city³⁷, should take such steps as might be
necessary for the safety of the commonwealth³⁸; it was further
π ordered that Pompeius should be empowered to raise new levies
ἵ throughout the whole of Italyae. He in a very short time collected
Ἰ a sufficient force for the protection of the city. Soon afterwards,
Ἰ two youths, both of them named Appius Claudius, the sons of Caius
Claudius brother of Publiusw, being desirous that their uncle's
3 death should be investigated, and acting as if it were their father's
J wish, applied to Pompeius for a summons requiring the produc-
, tion of the households of Milo and his wife Fausta, for exami-
nation by torture. The same two establishments of slaves were
called for by two of the Valerii, named Nepos and Leo, and also

his military power (imperium) within

people. Pompeius was proconsul of
